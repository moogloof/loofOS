# LoofOS Kernel Design stuff
Some stuff about the design considerations of loofOS. It will hopefully prevent the codebase from becoming a clusterheck of badness.

## Processes and Threads
- No process or thread hierarchy.
	- Process and threads can spawn threads and processes, but there will be no parent or child structure.
	- Many-to-one model will be used
- Interprocess communication will consist of global mailboxes attached to each process (total of 4KiB mailboxes per process)
	- Mailboxes will remain in a "closed" state until they are opened by a read request.
	- The 0th, 1st, and 2nd mailboxes will be stdout, stdin, and stderr, respectively.
	- For the kernel, there will also be mailboxes, but only accessible by the kernel.
- Round robin scheduler design will be used
